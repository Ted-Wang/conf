### CLI tips
#- move
- alt+f/b move foward/backward a word
- ctrl+a/e move to the start/end of line
- ctrl+left/right, home/end  works for some terminal

#- cut and paste
- ctrl+shift+- undo, ----其实是ctrl+_  ，没找到redo
- ctrl+k/u cut from cursor to the end/start of line
- alt+d/BS cut from cursor to the end/start of word
- ctrl+w cut from cursor to previous whitespace
- ctrl+y paste the last cut text
- alt+y loop through and paste previously cut text (must use it after ctrl+y)
- CTRL+t Swap the last two characters before the cursor.
- ESC+t Swap the last two words before the cursor.

#- OP on history
- ctrl+r then type term, to search over history, repeat ctrl+r to loop through matched results
- ctrl+r twice, search the last remembered search term
- ctrl+j end the search and keep the current matching histroy entry. ESC will be OK as well, but will got a beep
- ctrl+g cancel the search and restore original line
- Up/Down arrow keys，go through the history

### String Operation in shell script
str="a sample string"
echo ${#str}
echo ${str:2:9}
echo ${str:0-13:9}
echo ${str#*sam}        # get string right of "sam"
echo ${str##*\ }        # get string right of last " "
echo ${str%am*}         # get string left of "am"
echo ${str%%\ *}        # get string left of last " "

str5="${name}Script: ${url}index.html"  # concatenate strings

### add proxy for shell
export http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8118
